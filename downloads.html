		<p>I code my games in java so you will need a download of <a href="https://java.com/en/" target="_blank">java</a> </p>
		<p>To run my games, I have made a key, simply put the key in the downloaded folder with the Art and .bin folders all together </p>
		<a href="Key.bat" target="_blank">Key</a>
		<p> (Your pc might be scared of the key, it's safe I promise) </p>
